## Dataset Licenses

It is crucial to understand the license associated with a dataset before using it.  The license defines how you are permitted to use, modify, and share the data.

**License Types:**

*   **Public Domain:**
    *   **PUBLIC DOMAIN MARK - PUBLIC DOMAIN:**  No license; all rights are open to everyone.
    *   **OPEN DATA COMMONS PUBLIC DOMAIN DEDICATION AND LICENSE (PDDL):**  Functionally equivalent to public domain, but uses a licensing mechanism.

*   **Attribution Licenses (Require Giving Credit):**
    *   **CREATIVE COMMONS ATTRIBUTION 4.0 INTERNATIONAL (CC-BY):**  Allows sharing and modification, but requires attribution to the creator(s).
    *   **OPEN DATA COMMONS ATTRIBUTION LICENSE (ODC-BY):** Similar to CC-BY, but specifically for data.

*   **ShareAlike Licenses (Require Sharing Modifications Under the Same License):**
    *   **CREATIVE COMMONS ATTRIBUTION-SHAREALIKE 4.0 INTERNATIONAL (CC-BY-SA):** Allows use, sharing, and adaptation, but requires attribution and that any derivative works be shared under the same license.
    *   **COMMUNITY DATA LICENSE AGREEMENT – CDLA-SHARING-1.0:**  A "copyleft" license; modifications must be shared without adding new restrictions.
    *   **OPEN DATA COMMONS OPEN DATABASE LICENSE (ODC-ODBL):**  Similar to CC-BY-SA, but specifically for databases. Requires attribution and sharing of modifications.

*   **Permissive Licenses (With Disclaimers):**
     * **COMMUNITY DATA LICENSE AGREEMENT – CDLA PERMISSIVE-2.0:** Allows users to use, modify, adapt, and share the dataset, but only if a disclaimer of warranties and liability is also included.

*   **Non-Commercial Licenses (Restrict Commercial Use):**
    *   **CREATIVE COMMONS ATTRIBUTION-NONCOMMERCIAL 4.0 INTERNATIONAL (CC BY-NC):**  Allows sharing and adaptation with attribution, but prohibits commercial use.

*   **No Derivatives Licenses (Restrict Modifications):**
    *   **CREATIVE COMMONS ATTRIBUTION-NO DERIVATIVES 4.0 INTERNATIONAL (CC BY-ND):**  Allows sharing with attribution, but prohibits any modifications.

*   **Combined Restrictions:**
    *   **CREATIVE COMMONS ATTRIBUTION-NONCOMMERCIAL-SHAREALIKE 4.0 INTERNATIONAL (CC BY-NC-SA):** Allows sharing with attribution, modifications must be shared under the same license, and commercial use is prohibited.
    *   **CREATIVE COMMONS ATTRIBUTION-NONCOMMERCIAL-NODERIVATIVES 4.0 INTERNATIONAL (CC BY-NC-ND):**  Allows sharing with attribution, but prohibits modifications and commercial use. This is the most restrictive Creative Commons license.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always carefully read and understand the license terms before using any dataset.
*   If you are unsure about the license terms, contact the dataset provider for clarification.
*   Failure to comply with the license terms can lead to legal issues.
